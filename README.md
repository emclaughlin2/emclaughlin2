- Hi there 👋 I'm Emma McLaughlin.
- I am interested in using data-driven approaches to drive innovation and efficiency, especially in energy, infrastructure, and technology fields.
- I am currently working as a graduate researcher in experimental nuclear and particle physics with day-to-day experience analyzing large-scale datasets using statistical/machine learning methods, developing Monte Carlo simulations and supporting large capital project operations using data-driven insights.
- A PDF version of my resume is available [here](https://github.com/emclaughlin2/emclaughlin2/blob/main/Resume%20Dec%202025.pdf) and contains similar information to this README

## Graduate Research Assistant, Columbia University, 2021 – present
- Led two task forces (4 and 8 scientists) to award-winning [presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1479384/contributions/6632181/attachments/3134704/5561588/IS25_flashtalk_Emma.pdf) and [publication](https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/h8d5-swg6) of 1-2 year long physics analyses with high-volume data using statistical methods including work with iterative Bayesian unfolding and highly correlated measurements using Python, SQL, Pandas, C++, and the ROOT framework
- Updated sPHENIX C++-based Monte Carlo simulation, scripting and analysis integration codebases, including [low-level waveform reconstruction and analysis using least squares fit to a template function](https://github.com/emclaughlin2/sPHENIX-calorimeter-monitoring/blob/main/README_reconstruction_issues.md) and geometry updates, with optimizations for time complexity and scalability to 10s of billions of events

## Particle Physics Detector On-call Expert, sPHENIX Experiment, Brookhaven National Lab 2023 – present
- Built and maintain detector state [database logging and real-time monitoring data visualization](https://github.com/emclaughlin2/sPHENIX-calorimeter-monitoring/blob/main/README.md) using Python, PostgreSQL, and Grafana (3 years of continuous operation)
- Independently investigated a suspected hardware failure in analog-to-digital converter readout boards to finding a firmware issue and enabling a software patch to avoid hardware replacement with approx. $3M savings
- Serve as on-call subsystem expert responsible for 24/7 consistent operation of the sPHENIX calorimeters
  
## Public Programs Academic Administration Fellow, Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University 2024-2025
- Built Airtable database of contacts from NYC schools, community organizations, public housing to streamline program promotion and track participation of targeted communities
  
## NASA Space Apps Challenge Graduate Student Mentor, Barnard Computational Science Center 2025
- Provided technical data analysis and creative guidance to undergraduate team using NASA Earth data
- Scheduled workshop review of statistical and ML analysis techniques, including Iterative Proportional Fitting for sparse data, random forest and RNN models, and provided technical guidance for successful [random forest exoplanet classification project](https://github.com/madelinejmg/eXoxoAi/blob/main/README.md) using Python and sklearn

## Education
- PhD Candidate in Physics, Expected graduation May 2026, Columbia University 
- M.A. in Physics, May 2022, Columbia University
- B.S. in Physics, May 2020, Providence College
